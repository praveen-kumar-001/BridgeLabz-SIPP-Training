This repository contains a comprehensive set of Java exercises and solutions, organized by topic and difficulty. Each folder contains modular Java programs for practice and learning, from basic programming elements to advanced string and date operations.

## Folder Structure

**********************************Day-1**********************************************************
### ProgrammingElements
- **Level1/Level2**: Foundational Java programs for basic programming concepts (calculators, converters, area, averages, etc.)


***********************************Day-2********************************************************
### ControlFlows
- **Level-1**: Simple control flow exercises (loops, conditions, number sign, voting eligibility, etc.)
- **Level-2**: Intermediate control flow (factors, FizzBuzz, multiples, power, etc.)
- **Level-3**: Advanced control flow (abundant/Armstrong/Harshad numbers, leap year, calculators, etc.)


**********************************Day-3**********************************************************
### Arrays
- **Level-1**: Basic array operations (copying, factors, FizzBuzz, mean, multiplication tables, etc.)
- **Level 2**: Intermediate array problems (BMI, bonus calculation, digit frequency, student grades, etc.)


**********************************Day-4**********************************************************
### JavaMethods
- **Level-1**: Basic methods (interest calculation, handshakes, trigonometry, etc.)
- **Level-2**: Intermediate method-based problems (BMI, factors, leap year, etc.)
- **Level-3**: Advanced method-based problems (calendar, collinearity, matrix, OTP, scorecard, etc.)


**********************************Day-6**********************************************************
### JavaStrings
- **Level-1**: String basics (comparison, substring, char array conversion, exceptions, case conversion, etc.)
- **Level-2**: String manipulation (manual length, splitting, word analysis, vowels/consonants, trimming, voting, games, scorecard, etc.)
- **Level-3**: Advanced string logic (BMI table, unique chars, frequency, palindrome, anagram, calendar, deck of cards, etc.)



**********************************Day-7**********************************************************
### BuiltInFunction
- Java programs demonstrating the use of built-in functions and standard libraries:
    - Number guessing game
    - Max of three numbers
    - Prime checker
    - Fibonacci sequence
    - Palindrome checker
    - Factorial (recursion)
    - GCD/LCM calculator
    - Temperature converter
    - Basic calculator
    - Time zones with `ZonedDateTime`
    - Date arithmetic, formatting, and comparison


## How to Use
- Each `.java` file is self-contained and can be compiled and run independently.
- Explore each folder for topic-specific exercises and solutions.
- Use these as practice, reference, or teaching material for Java programming.
